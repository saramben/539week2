            <img src="images/milo_on_carpet.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Fluffy small white dog on white carpet.">

            <p>Milo is a high maintenance, lazy dog who prefers lounging over running. His favorite food to eat is Indian food, and he loves anything with chicken in it. He especially loves chicken, but it must be marinated and seasoned. </p>
